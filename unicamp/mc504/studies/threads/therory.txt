* POSIX Threads (pthread)

- A thread API for C/C++
- It is most effictive on a multi-core system
- Threads require less overhead than "forking" because the system will not initialize a a new system virtual memory space and other environment for the process.
- It is also usefull for system that rely on I/O (One thread may execute while another is waiting for I/O or some other system latency)
- All threads within a process share the same address space
- Thread operations includes:
 - creation
 - termination
 - synchronization (join/block)
 - scheduling
 - data managment
 - process interation
- A thread does not know a thing about other threads
- Threads in the same process share:
 - Process instruction
 - Most Data
 - Open files
 - signals and signal handlers
 - current working directory
 - user and group ip
- Each thread has a unique
 - Thread ID
 - set of register, stack pointer
 - stack for local variables, return address
 - signal mask
 - priority
 - return value: errno
