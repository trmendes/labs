## What is it about?

It's just me taking some time to study some languages after five years away from computers!

## Goal

Learn! Practice!

## Help?!

I'm open to tips to become a better developer. By that I mean: I want to be able to write code that is possible to read and understand. I wanna learn how to organize a code better too. Anyway...any kind of help will be amazing here :)
